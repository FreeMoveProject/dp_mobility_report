The following statistics give insights into the distribution of the visits over the tiles (mean, min, max and quartiles) 
- whether there are tiles that are visited more often than others or if the visits are distributed equally over all tiles.

<div>
A different way of visualizing the distribution of visits over tiles is achieved by the cumuluated sum of all visits: If only a few tiles include most of all visits, the curve has a steep increase in the beginning and a flat part at the end. 
If the visits are distributed equally over the entire tiles the line is a straight diagonal.
