<h4>Intra-tile flows</h4>

The number and percentage of flows that start and end within the same tile.

A large number of intra-cell flows either indicate round-trips 
(e.g., going running starting and ending at the home location) 
or a tessellation that is to coarse to properly capture flows.

<div>
    A different way of visualizing the distribution of number per flows is achieved by the cumuluated sum of all flows: 
    If only a few flows include most of all visits, the curve has a steep increase in the beginning and a flat part at the end. 
    If the visits are distributed equally over the entire flows the line is a straight diagonal.
