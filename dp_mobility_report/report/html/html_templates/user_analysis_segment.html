<h3>Time between two consecutive trajectories of a user</h3>

How much time passes between two consecutive trajeoctories? 
This information gives insights on the temporal density of the dataset. 
Trajectories might follow each other consecutively, then the time inbetween only is as long as the stay duration at that place. 
If the trips are only collected sparsely there might be days between single trajectories of a user.

<br>

This analysis is based on the assumption that trips of a user follow each other consecutively and do not overlap, 
i.e., the start time of a following trip cannot start before the previous one has ended.
Therefore, we first perform a plausibility check to ensure that no user trips overlap. 
Otherwise this might be an indication for a faulty dataset.

<h4>Plausibility check: overlapping user trips</h4>

If there are overlapping trips present in the dataset the minimum time between trajectories will be negative.

<h3>Radius of gyration</h3>

The radius of gyration is the characteristic distance traveled by an individual during a period of time.

<h3>Location entropy</h3>

Location entropy (based on Shannon Entropy) captures the diversity of user visits. 
If most trips to a certain location originate from a single (or few) user the entropy is low. 
A high entropy suggests that the place is visited by diverse users evenly. A dataset with many cells with high visit counts but low entropy suggests, that single users drive certain mobility patterns that might not be representative for other users.

<h3>Number of distinct tiles per user</h3>

TODO: clean outliers - or not necessary as data set is already truncated?

How many different tiles does a single user visit?

<h3>Uncorrelated Entropy</h3>

The temporal-uncorrelated entropy characterizes the heterogeneity of the users visitation patterns (including the historical probability that a location was visited by the user).

TODO: clean outliers - or not necessary for uncorrelated entropy, as it is normalized?
