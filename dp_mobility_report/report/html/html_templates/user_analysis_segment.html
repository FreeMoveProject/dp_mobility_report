    <h3>Time between consecutive trips of a user</h3>
    
    <p class="info">
        The time between consecutive trips gives insights into the completeness of 
        user movements. This analysis is based on the assumption that trips of a user follow 
        each other consecutively and do not overlap, 
        i.e., a trip cannot start before the previous one has ended.
        Therefore, a plausibility check is performed first to ensure that user trips do not overlap. 
        Otherwise, this might be an indication of a faulty dataset.

    <p class="info">
        If there are overlapping trips present in the dataset the minimum time 
        between trips is negative.

    <h3>Location entropy</h3>
    <p class="info">
        The location entropy captures the diversity of user visits. 
        If most trips to a certain location originate from only few users the entropy is low. 
        A high entropy suggests that the place is visited by diverse users evenly.

    <h3>Mobility entropy</h3>
    <p class="info">
        The mobility entropy characterizes the heterogeneity of the users visitation patterns
        and can be interpreted as a measure for the predictability of a users location.
        If a user only visits a single tile, the entropy is 0, i.e., their location is highly predictable.
        It a user visits, e.g., four different tiles each 10 times, the entropy is 1, i.e., their 
        location is not predictable as every of the four tiles has the same probability 
        to be visited by the user.
        Intuitively, the more trips per user are entailed in the data, the more meaningful the mobility entropy.
