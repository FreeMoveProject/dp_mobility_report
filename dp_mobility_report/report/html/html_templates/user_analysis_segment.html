    <p class="info">
        The mobility entropy characterizes the heterogeneity of the users visitation patterns
        and can be interpreted as a measure for the predictability of a users location.
        If a user only visits a single tile, the entropy is 0, i.e., their location is highly predictable.
        It a user visits, e.g., four different tiles each 10 times, the entropy is 1, i.e., their 
        location is not predictable as every of the four tiles has the same probability 
        to be visited by the user.
        Intuitively, the more trips per user are entailed in the data, the more meaningful the mobility entropy.
